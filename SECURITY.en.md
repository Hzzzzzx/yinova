Include: description, steps to reproduce, impact, suggested fix if any.

We aim to acknowledge within **48 hours** and respond within **7 days**.

## Best Practices

### For Users

- Protect API Keys: use env vars or config (in .gitignore), rotate regularly
- Network: panel runs on localhost by default; use VPN/reverse proxy for remote access
- File permissions: ensure `yin/moltbot.json` has correct permissions
- Run `npm audit` periodically

### For Developers

- Validate input, prevent path traversal, validate port ranges
- No hardcoded secrets; use env vars; check .gitignore
- Don't leak sensitive info in errors
- Pin dependency versions

## Config

- Ports: panel 3999, main gateway 18789, hexagrams 18791+
- Token in `yin/moltbot.json` is auto-generated by `install.sh`
- Env vars: `ZAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `YINOVA_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, etc.
